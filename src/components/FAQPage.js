              The ideal water temperature for pour-over coffee is between 195째F
              and 205째F (90째C to 96째C). This range ensures proper extraction
              without scorching the coffee.{" "}

              It is recommended to bloom the coffee grounds for around 30
              seconds. Start by saturating the grounds with a small amount of
              hot water and let them release trapped gases before continuing
              with the pour.

              The recommended pouring technique for pour-over coffee is to pour
              in a circular motion, starting from the center and gradually
              moving outward, while maintaining a steady and controlled flow
              rate.
